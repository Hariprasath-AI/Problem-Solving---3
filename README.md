# Problem-Solving---3

# Description :
My Problem is to solve series of numbers. 
# Input Constraints :
Given inputs are, start and stop. 
The start is an any value greater than zero and stop must be greater than start.
# Example 1 -> Input :
start = 1, stop = 5
# Example 1 -> output :
15
# Example 1 -> Explanation :
1 +..+..+ 5 -> 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15
This is what we need.. 
# Traditional Programmer's Approach (Python Code) :
N = int(input())
for i in range(start, stop + 1):
